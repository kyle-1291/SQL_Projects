# Customer Churn Analysis using SQL & Power BI

The project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for an e-commerce business by leveraging SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for dynamic visualization and reporting.

## Overview

Customer churn occurs when individuals choose to stop purchasing from a business, which can significantly impact customer retention and overall business performance. In the highly competitive world of e-commerce, keeping customers engaged is essential. To overcome this challenge, it is important to identify customers who are likely to leave and implement focused strategies to encourage them to stay.
